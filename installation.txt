Installing an running the code is easy, but requires a working AMUSE
repository. Installing AMUSE is non-trivial.
Here are a few guidelines that generally work.
for a more complete guide see the project's website: amusecode.org

The easiest way to install amuse is via pip
%> pip install amuse.framework
%> pip install ph4
should be enough to get the code running.


For a more complete, developers version, of AMUSE follow the following
guidelines:

%> conda create -n amuse
%> conda activate amuse
%> mkdir amuse
%> cd amuse
%> git clone https://github.com/amusecode/amuse.git .
%> conda install python
%> conda install numpy
%> conda install scipy
%> conda install h5py
%> conda install pytest
%> conda install docutils
%> conda install mpfr
%> ./configure --prefix=$CONDA_PREFIX
%> make DOWNLOAD_CODES=1
%> pip install -e .
%> python setup.py develop_build

Probably not all AMUSE packages are build, but certainly enough for
performing a few satisfying calculations.
